# automatic-school-ringer
how i made this / story: "smart" governants => chaos in (some) schools due to the removal of the service shift for highschool students that used to trigger the saving bell every day. at that moment, not many schools had an automatic ringer which costed at the time of writing around 300 euros.

because i like programming & messing up with random hardware & creating stuff from scratch i volunteered to build a "thing" in ~3 days which would ring so the ETERNAL FRENCH CLASSES could not eat any more of the short break time.

the bell in my school is triggered by a "light switch" that would auto-release itself after you take your had off it (i dont know how its called but it looks exactly like a usual one; a light switch with a spring inside at one end)
into the light switch were inserted 2 wires -  hot wire and a ground one; 

connect these 2 wires => bell rings;

disconnect there 2 wires => nothing

=> we have a "how to turn on a lightbulb with arduino + relay tutorial" youtube situation. hope you got the idea.
